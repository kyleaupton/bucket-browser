## About

This Electron.js application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the official AWS S3 SDK. It allows you to easily connect to your S3-compatible storage by specifying the endpoint, region, access key, and secret key. Once connected, you can browse through your buckets and objects, as well as ~~upload~~ (coming soon) and download files directly from the app. This tool is designed to simplify the management of your S3 storage, offering a better experience for handling your cloud data.
